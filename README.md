## Project Overview:
This project entails a comprehensive analysis of sales and product data. Python is employed for data extraction and visualization, while PostgreSQL aids in conducting in-depth analysis.

## Data & Tool Used:
**Data** - E-commerce Sales dataset obtained from Kaggle.com\
**Data Cleaning&Analysis** - Utilized Python and PostgreSQL\
**Data Visualization** - Leveraged Panel and Holoviews libraries

## Questions:
1. What specific month recorded the highest sales and profit figures?
2. Which city stands out with the highest total sales?
3. Among the products, which one has garnered the highest sales?

## Summary of Findings
* January stands out as the month with the highest sales, amounting to $68,483, accompanied by a profit of $5,359.
* Even though August was the top 2 highest sale, it still accumulated a negative profit.
* The Indore City has accumulated $79,069 sales,  whereas Amritsar had the lowest sales at $5,407.
* The top sale product is printer which generated sales worth $58,252.
* A crucial observation arises from analyzing profit versus sales. Despite positive sales in all three categories (Electronics, Furniture, Clothing), a significant number of instances within these categories exhibit negative profits.\
 This suggests potential profitability challenges that need to be addressed, particularly in understanding the factors contributing to the divergence between sales and profit within each category.
* Every customer in the dataset appears to be distinct.

## Recommendation:
* A comprehensive exploration of sales versus profit across all categories is recommended to understand the reasons behind the negative profit values.
* Consider leveraging the untapped potential of the 'target sales.csv' dataset for alternative forms of analysis.
